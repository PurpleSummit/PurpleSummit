<h1>Completed Projects</h1>

<h2>2025</h2>

06/02/2025 – Taylor series for sin x. Input: the angle x in degrees and n, the number of terms in the Taylor series to add together. Output: whether if sin x and the resulting sum vary by less than 0.001

NOTICE: Not up-to-date. 15+ projects, related to Flask, Django, JavaScript, CS50W, and CS50AI, are not recorded.

<h2>2024</h2>

01/12/2024 – Solves for x when given values a, b, c (in ax^2 + bx + c) (a, b, and c can be 0, so both quadratic and linear equations can be handled while catching exceptions like 52 = 0).

03/14/2024 – Returns coordinates of a decagon in standard position after a given rotation and the decagon's side lengths.

03/15/2024 – Returns colinear property of three given points.

??/??/2024 – PROJECT. Input: two images. Output: the second image with the same color properties (brightness, saturation, etc.) as the first

... 3/28/2024 – opens image
	
... 4/22~24/2024 – made/edited a function turning rgba values into hsv values. By then, made four separate files, one for user interaction, one for reading and getting values, one to check images/values/color modes, and another for editing images. The editing file includes functions that edits brightness, contrast, saturation, and sharpness.
	
... 4/26/2024 – working on rescaling images
	
... 5/31/2024 – finished! Roughly. Make better.
