- 👋 Hi, I’m @PurpleSummit, aka Violet! Nice to meet y'all.
- 👀 I’m interested in... writing fantasy, sci-fi, dystopian, and realistic fiction. Oh, and of course, coding! I want to be an AI programmer, but... sadly, I have a lot to learn before I do it. ;D I'm still chaotic about what to do, but most people recommend doing coding as main and writing as a habit. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... python, a bit of javascript, and things here and there, such as writing techniques, French, and Spanish.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... mostly anything! I am always eager to lend you a hand... (as long as it's not literal * wink wink*)
- 📫 How to reach me... I don't have any social media accounts ;-; so sorry! 😿
- 📖 My hobbies... reading, writing, *coding*, making things, etc. etc.
