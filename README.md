<h1>Completed Projects</h1>

<h2>Undated</h2>
square_list : when provided with a positive real number, it outputs a series of perfect squares that are smaller or equal to the inputted number

<h2>2022</h2>
08/05/2022 – Input: decimal number. Output: base 8 equivalent. Done for MMM month in August (Math, Music, Meditation). coded for Hard Math for Elementary School by Glenn Ellison. Edited 1/27/2024
10/05/2022 – Weighted average. Updated on 1/30/2024.
11/30/2022 – Input: two Cartesian plane points. Output: distance between the two points.
12/28/2022 – HTML website

<h2>2023</h2>
06/27/2023 – PROJECT. Input: tuples (year, month, day). Output: days between them. [Same date = 0 days]
		v.0.0. 06/14~20/2023 – long, complicated handling of various casework (same date, same month, same year, adjacent year) with the use of tuples
		v.0.1. 06/26/2023 – much more simplified with the use of tuples and for loops
		v.0.2. 06/27/2023 – improvised version of v.0.2, but with exceptions
		Unit Test 11/09/2023
		v.0.3 06/19/2024 – added some guardians so that preconditions are ensured, added comments
		06/13/2023 – outputs day of the week when provided with a date (imported module)
		06/22/2023 – minimized scale; distance between two months (month, year)
10/26/2023 – GIF converter

<h2>2024</h2>
01/12/2024 – Input: a, b, c (in ax2 + bx + c) (a, b, and c can be 0, so both quadratic and linear equations can be handled) Output: solution x.
01/29/2024 – Input: a, b (ax + b) (equation of a line), a point. Output: shortest distance between the point and the line.
01/30/2024 – Input: three points. Output: area of the formed triangle.
02/14/2024 – Coursera project. Time calculation functions
03/14/2024 – Input: side length of decagon, angle of rotation. Output: the vertices’ coordinates when the origin is 0,0 (a list of 10 tuples)
03/15/2024 – Input: list of points (tuples in form x,y). Output: whether or not there are three collinear points
03/18/2024 – Input: side length of a decagon tilted at a 45° angle clockwise. Output: the vertices’ coordinates when the origin is 0,0 (a list of 10 tuples)
??/??/2024 – PROJECT. Input: two images. Output: the second image with the same color properties (brightness, saturation, etc.) as the first
	v.0.0. 3/28/2024 – opens image
	… insert tedious descriptions, lines of code transferred, and research (lots of research)
	v.1.0. 4/22~24/2024 – made/edited a function turning rgba values into hsv values. By then, made four separate files, one for user interaction, one for reading and getting values, one to check images/values/color modes, and another for editing images. The editing file includes functions that edits brightness, contrast, saturation, and sharpness.
	… 4/26/2024 – working on rescaling images
	v.2.0. 5/31/2024 – finished! Roughly. Make better.
06/12/2024 – Website. Archive of characters.
06/18/2024 – Website. Mp3 music player replaces an image when the image is clicked.
09/06/2024 – Website with Flask. Remodeling Archive.
09/09/2024 – Input: none. Returns: the smallest k in which the decimal expansion of 1/(5^k * 37) has the hundreth digit of 1.
09/09/2024 – Input: height of a building in feet. Output: how many seconds it takes a ball, at rest before being dropped from the building, to hit the ground.
10/03/2024 – CS50 Final Project. Website that simulates physics experiments such as dropping a ball from a cliff or launching them from cannons.
12/03/2024 – Graphs the function x2 + 2x + 3 and its derivative.
12/04/2024 – Iterative sequence 1 + 1/x
12/13/2024 – Research Mind Math 2024 Winter Camp website

__ various projects related to Flask, Django, JavaScript and CS50W __

<h2>2025</h2>
06/02/2025 – Taylor series for sin x. Input: the angle x in degrees and n, the number of terms in the Taylor series to add together. Output: whether if sin x and the resulting sum vary by less than 0.001
