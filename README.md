__ various projects related to Flask, Django, JavaScript and CS50W __

<h2>2024</h2>

01/12/2024 – Solves for x when given values a, b, c (in ax^2 + bx + c) (a, b, and c can be 0, so both quadratic and linear equations can be handled while catching exceptions like 52 = 0).

01/29/2024 – Returns shortest distance between a point and a line given the coordinates of the point and the coefficients of the line's defining linear equation.

01/30/2024 – Returns area of triangle given three coordinate points.

3/13/2024 – With positive integers m and n, evaluate Ackermann’s function
                 
		  – Prints a “factorial arrow”
		  
          – Evaluates if given word is a palindrome

03/14/2024 – Returns coordinates of a decagon in standard position after a given rotation and the decagon's side lengths.

03/15/2024 – Returns colinear property of three given points.

??/??/2024 – PROJECT. Input: two images. Output: the second image with the same color properties (brightness, saturation, etc.) as the first

	3/28/2024 – opens image
	
	4/22~24/2024 – made/edited a function turning rgba values into hsv values. By then, made four separate files, one for user interaction, one for reading and getting values, one to check images/values/color modes, and another for editing images. The editing file includes functions that edits brightness, contrast, saturation, and sharpness.
	
	... 4/26/2024 – working on rescaling images
	
	5/31/2024 – finished! Roughly. Make better.

<h2>2023</h2>
06/27/2023 – Returns the number of days between two given dates (inputted in tuples) [Same date = 0 days]</p>

		06/14~20/2023 – long, complicated handling of various casework (same date, same month, same year, adjacent year) with the use of tuples
		
		06/26/2023 – much more simplified with the use of tuples and for loops
		
		06/27/2023 – improvised version of v.0.2, but with exceptions
		
		Unit Test 11/09/2023
		
		06/19/2024 – added some guardians so that preconditions are ensured, added comments
		
		06/13/2023 – outputs day of the week when provided with a date (imported module)
		
		06/22/2023 – minimized scale; distance between two months (month, year)
